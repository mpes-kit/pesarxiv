An experimental photoemission spectra archive, excerpted from the momentum space, for benchmarking algorithms

### Disclaimer

The coordinate calibrations of the data deposited here are conducted using conventions of the respective depositor. Therefore, they may be subject to errors and biases, such as constant shifts, linear or nonlinear shifts of the coordinate origin and scaling, etc. However, these potential deficiencies do not affect the purpose of benchmarking algorithms. The use of such data for other purposes should be carried out at your own discretion.

### Materials list

Photoemission spectra from the following materials are currently included,

- WSe<sub>2</sub> (2H packing, bulk)
- ...

### Versioned releases

The data archive will continuously be version-linked with a Zenodo data repository, where larger files (than 100 MB) are stored. The Zenodo repository contains entire versioned datasets while the GitHub repository contains smaller files (for small scale demos) and more frequent updates.
